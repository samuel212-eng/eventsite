## How CRUD works (simple explanation)

| Action | URL | Who can do it |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| **C**reate | /events/create/ | Logged-in users |
| **R**ead | /events/ and /events/1/ | Everyone |
| **U**pdate | /events/1/edit/ | Event organiser only |
| **D**elete | /events/1/delete/ | Event organiser only |

## Tech used

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Django** | The Python web framework — handles everything |
| **SQLite** | The database — a simple file, no install needed |
| **Bootstrap 5** | CSS framework — makes things look good fast |
| **Pillow** | Python library for handling image uploads |
| **Google Fonts** | Beautiful typography (Syne + DM Sans) |

## Going live (production checklist)

1. Change `SECRET_KEY` in settings.py to something random
2. Set `DEBUG = False`
3. Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com']`
4. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
5. Serve static files with WhiteNoise or a CDN

## If pillow does not activate

Run:
    1. Source myenv/bin/activate
    2. Pip install Pillow
    3. python manage.py runserver
